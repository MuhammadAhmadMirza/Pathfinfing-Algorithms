# Description: 
#   A* is an informed search algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes by using both the actual cost from the start (g score)
#   and an estimated cost to the goal (h score). This combination helps prioritize paths that appear closer to the goal.

# Features:
#   Heuristics: Utilizes a heuristic function (h score) to estimate the cost from a node to the goal, along with the actual path cost (g score), combining them to form the f score.
#   Open Set: Maintains nodes to be evaluated in a priority queue, prioritized by their f score.

# Pros:
#   Efficient pathfinding, especially when a good heuristic is used, as it can guide the search towards the goal more directly.
#   Guarantees the shortest path if the heuristic is admissible (does not overestimate the true cost).

# Cons:
#   The efficiency is dependent on the quality of the heuristic; a poor heuristic can lead to inefficiency.
#   More complex to implement, particularly in choosing and designing an appropriate heuristic function.

# using:
#   1. Open Set: Nodes to be evaluated.
#   2. Closed Set: Nodes already evaluated.
#   3. g Score: Cost from the start node to a node.
#   4. h Score: Heuristic estimate from a node to the goal.
#   5. f Score: g+h (total estimated cost).

# Steps:
#   1. Add the start node to the open set.
#   2. While the open set is not empty:
#       1. Remove the node with the lowest f score.
#       2. If itâ€™s the goal node, return the path.
#       3. Generate neighbors, calculate their g, h and f scores
#       4. Add unvisited neighbors to the open set.
#       5. Move the node to the closed set.
