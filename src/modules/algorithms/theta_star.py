# Description:
#   Theta* is an optimization technique for A* pathfinding that introduces more direct paths by allowing shortcuts 
#   when traversing between nodes. It refines A* by permitting straight-line paths when they provide a better route, 
#   which can lead to more optimal paths in certain scenarios.
#
# Features:
#   Heuristics: Uses Manhattan distance heuristic to estimate the cost from the current node to the goal.
#   Shortcuts: Enables direct connections between nodes if they improve the path efficiency, allowing for straight-line 
#              paths when they are beneficial.
#
# Pros:
#   Can find shorter and more efficient paths compared to standard A* by allowing direct connections.
#   Retains the optimality and completeness of A* while potentially enhancing performance with better pathfinding.
#
# Cons:
#   More complex implementation due to the need to validate and manage direct connections between nodes.
#   Performance gains might be less significant in highly complex or dense grids where shortcuts are less effective.
#
# Steps:
#   1. Add the start node to the open set with an initial cost of 0.
#   2. While the open set is not empty:
#       1. Remove the node with the lowest f score (g + h).
#       2. If itâ€™s the goal node, reconstruct and return the path.
#       3. For each neighbor:
#           1. Update the g score and f score for the neighbor.
#           2. If the neighbor is not in the open set, add it.
#           3. Validate potential shortcuts by checking if a direct path from the current node to a neighbor is valid and improves the path.
