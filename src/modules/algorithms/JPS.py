# Description:
#   Jump Point Search (JPS) is an optimization technique for A* pathfinding. It reduces the number of nodes that need
#   to be explored by skipping over large sections of nodes, especially in uniform-cost grids. This is done by identifying
#   "jump points" that are significant in the pathfinding process and only evaluating those.

# Features:
#   Heuristics: Uses Manhattan distance heuristic to estimate the cost from the current node to the goal.
#   Jump Points: Skips non-critical nodes and focuses on "jump points" that are crucial for finding the optimal path.

# Pros:
#   Can significantly reduce the number of nodes explored compared to standard A*, especially in open areas.
#   Maintains the optimality and completeness of A*.

# Cons:
#   More complex implementation due to the identification of jump points.
#   Performance gain is less significant in very dense or highly complex grids.

# Steps:
#   1. Add the start node to the open set with an initial cost of 0.
#   2. While the open set is not empty:
#       1. Remove the node with the lowest f score (g + h).
#       2. If itâ€™s the goal node, reconstruct and return the path.
#       3. For each direction from the current node:
#           1. Jump in the current direction until a jump point is found or an obstacle is hit.
#           2. If a jump point is found:
#               1. Update the g score.
#               2. Record the current node as the predecessor of the jump point.
#               3. If the jump point is not in the open set, add it.
