# Description: 
#   Dijkstra's algorithm is a pathfinding algorithm used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph. 
#   It works by exploring all possible paths from the start node, prioritizing paths with the lowest accumulated cost 
#   until the goal is reached.

# Features:
#   Heuristics: Does not use a heuristic; relies solely on the actual path cost (g score).
#   Open Set: Maintains nodes to be evaluated in a priority queue based on their g score.

# Pros:
#   Guarantees the shortest path in graphs with non-negative weights.
#   Simple and can be applied to both unweighted and weighted graphs.

# Cons:
#   Can be slow and inefficient for large graphs due to exhaustive exploration.
#   Not as fast as others like A* for specific searches since it doesn't use heuristics to guide the search.

# using:
#   1. Open Set: Nodes to be evaluated, stored in a priority queue.
#   2. g Score: The cost from the start node to a node.

# Steps:
#   1. Add the start node to the open set with a g score of 0.
#   2. While the open set is not empty:
#       1. Remove the node with the lowest g score.
#       2. If itâ€™s the goal node, reconstruct and return the path.
#       3. For each neighbor of the current node:
#           1. Calculate the tentative g score.
#           2. If the tentative g score is lower than the current g score:
#               1. Update the g score.
#               2. Record the current node as the predecessor of the neighbor.
#           3. If the neighbor is not in the open set, add it.

# Note: This is equivalent to BFS when all the weights are equal to 1.
