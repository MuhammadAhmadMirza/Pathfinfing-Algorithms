# no need for priority queue as this algorithm doesn't have to decide between nodes

# Description:
#   DFS is an uninformed search algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

# Features:
#   - Utilizes a stack to keep track of the nodes to explore.
#   - Does not consider weights and may not find the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
#   - It doesn't guarantee the shortest path, but can be used to check if a path exists.

# Pros:
#   - Can be more memory efficient than BFS in certain situations, as it doesn't need to store all the nodes at the current depth.
#   - Can find solutions without exploring all nodes if the solution is deep.

# Cons:
#   - Does not guarantee the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
#   - Can get stuck in deep paths and miss shallower solutions.

# using:
#   1. Stack: Nodes to be explored, stored in a stack.
#   2. Visited Set: Tracks visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.
#   3. Parent Mapping: Maps nodes to their parents to reconstruct the path.

# Steps:
#   1. Add the start node to the stack.
#   2. While the stack is not empty:
#       1. Pop the top node.
#       2. If itâ€™s the goal node, return the path.
#       3. Generate neighbors.
#       4. Add unvisited neighbors to the stack.
#       5. Mark the node as visited.
