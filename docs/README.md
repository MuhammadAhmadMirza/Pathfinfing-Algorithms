# Pathfinding Algorithms

This project provides simple implementations of several graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms in Python. These algorithms are designed to find the shortest path between two points on a graph or grid.

## Algorithms Implemented
1. **Depth First Search (DFS)**
2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
3. **Bidirectional Search**
4. **A star Algorithm**
5. **Jump Point Search (JPS)**
6. **Theta star Algorithm**

## Features
- GUI for visualizing live search
- Customizable start and end points
- Adjustable grid size

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**

### Required Libraries
- `pygame`

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
